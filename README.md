# HCIProject
We are creating a UI for the United States voting system. This system does not take into account security measures, we are simply focusing on the human and computer interactions. 

# TO RUN
You will need to navigate to the folder named "hci" 
You will need to have npm installed and possible other dependencies from npm, you can use "npm install PACKAGE" for anything it is missing.
Once you are in the folder named "hci" you can run "npm start"
This will load the application on localhost:3000, from there you may navigate though the website.
